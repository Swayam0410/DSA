if you want to convert your string to number(int,long long)
one of the way is to take the substring and pass from STOI,but STOI(str) have time complexity of O(N)
otherwise you can traverse through the string and do temp=temp*10+str[i]-'0';the Final temp will be your answer
From the temp process you could get a string also.
