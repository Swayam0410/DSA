Arrays
If you want to change sort an array without changing that array,store it in a set.

If there is a talk about Substring(continious)-do give a think for SLIDING WINDOWS(a start index(initially 0) and then traverse for an end index and  if some condition fails,move forward the start)


IF YOU ARE ASKED TO GIVE THE LENGTH OF SOME SUBSTRING(CONTINIOUS) ,TRY IMPLEMENTING SLIDING WINDOWS(ITS LIKE OUR PREVIOUS POINT,WHERE LENGTH=END-START+1)
