Arrays
If you want to change sort an array without changing that array,store it in a set.

If there is a talk about Substring(continious)-do give a think for SLIDING WINDOWS(a start index(initially 0) and then traverse for an end index and  if some condition fails,move forward the start)


IF YOU ARE ASKED TO GIVE THE LENGTH OF SOME SUBSTRING(CONTINIOUS) ,TRY IMPLEMENTING SLIDING WINDOWS(ITS LIKE OUR PREVIOUS POINT,WHERE LENGTH=END-START+1)

AGAR AESA SITUATION AAYE,WHERE SOMETHING IS GOING LEFT ,SOMETHING IS GOING RIGHT(LIKE AESA SAMJHO KII AGAR 0TH INDEX MAI LEFT HAI,TOHH VO PURA LEFT HEE JAYEGA,LAST INDEX MAI RIGHT HAI,
TOHH PURA RIGHT HEE JAYEGA],TRY KARO KII 0TH MAI LEFT DALO,NTH MAI EK RIGHT DALO.AND TRY SOLVING IN BETWEEN THESE LEFT AND RIGHT.

WHENEVER THERE IS A QUESTION OF TILING(FITTING OF TILES IN AN MATRIX),TRY TO DERIVE AN FORMULA

MATRIX EXPONENTIATION-Matrix exponentiation is a math trick to compute repeating patterns (like Fibonacci) super fast â€” by turning the pattern into a matrix and raising it to a power using smart multiplication.
SMART MULTIPLICATION-(n%2==0)x=x*x,n/2 else ans=x*func(x,n-1);

IF YOU ARE ASKED ABOUT SUBSEQUENCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ,THINK FOR RECURSION OR DP(TAKE,NOTTAKE)

TOPOLOGICAL SORT/FOR DAG-IMPLEMENT IT,WHEN YOU ARE ASKED FOR SOMETHING LIKE SCHEDULE(WHAT TO DO FIRST,AND WHAT NEXT AND NEXT AND CONTINUE)

THINK OF 2 POINTERS,BINARY SEARCH-IF ARRAY IS SORTED.
