Arrays
If you want to change sort an array without changing that array,store it in a set.

If there is a talk about Substring(continious)-do give a think for SLIDING WINDOWS(a start index(initially 0) and then traverse for an end index and  if some condition fails,move forward the start)


IF YOU ARE ASKED TO GIVE THE LENGTH OF SOME SUBSTRING(CONTINIOUS) ,TRY IMPLEMENTING SLIDING WINDOWS(ITS LIKE OUR PREVIOUS POINT,WHERE LENGTH=END-START+1)

AGAR AESA SITUATION AAYE,WHERE SOMETHING IS GOING LEFT ,SOMETHING IS GOING RIGHT(LIKE AESA SAMJHO KII AGAR 0TH INDEX MAI LEFT HAI,TOHH VO PURA LEFT HEE JAYEGA,LAST INDEX MAI RIGHT HAI,
TOHH PURA RIGHT HEE JAYEGA],TRY KARO KII 0TH MAI LEFT DALO,NTH MAI EK RIGHT DALO.AND TRY SOLVING IN BETWEEN THESE LEFT AND RIGHT.
